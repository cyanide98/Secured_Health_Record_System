Secured Health Record System Built Using Netbeans & Java

This project provides a secured interface for the confidential information present in Electronic Health Record (EHR) which are vital and requires maximum security. An
Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an electronic version of a patient’s medical history, that is maintained by the provider over time, and may include all of the key
administrative clinical data relevant to that persons care under a particular provider, including demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical
history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports   The EHR automates access to information and has the potential to streamline the clinician&#39;s workflow.  The
EHR also has the ability to support other care-related activities directly or indirectly through various interfaces, including evidence-based decision support, quality
management, and outcomes reporting.
